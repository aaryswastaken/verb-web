### What is verb 

Verb is an application designed to learn more easily irregular verbs. 
For now, it has two languages built-in : English and German

This is the verb version (a rust version will be available SOONâ„¢) built on top of next.js and react

The first version has been done in the context of a 24h challenge so it surely contains a **LOT** of bugs. If you see some please report them in the [issue section](https://github.com/vsahler/verb-web/issues)
